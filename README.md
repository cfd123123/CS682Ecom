Boilerplate app based on [this tutorial](https://www.djamware.com/post/5ab6397c80aca714d19d5b9c/building-spring-boot-mongodb-and-reactjs-crud-web-application).  
  
To start the back end:  
`backend$ ./gradlew bootRun`

---

Build the front end:  
`frontend$ npm run build`  

This will cause the front end code to be built and moved into the `backend/src/main/resources/static` folder

---

You will also need to start MongoDB. On my mac I installed it using a package manager (homebrew) and started it with the command `mongod`.  
I'm not yet sure where the data lives on my computer, but  I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.
